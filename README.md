# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

## Overview

This is a web-based game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that lets users play the extended version of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Based on the version popularized by the show *The Big Bang Theory*, this version includes two additional choices—Lizard and Spock—adding more variety to the outcomes. The game displays both the user's and computer's choices, as well as the result of each round.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: A simple and responsive interface for easy play on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Randomized Computer Choice**: Each round, the computer makes a random selection from the five options.
- **Clear Instructions**: Rules of the game are displayed on the page, explaining each interaction (e.g., "Rock crushes Scissors").
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the user's and computer's scores across multiple rounds.
- **Reset Option**: Users can reset the game to start a new series.

## Game Rules

Each of the five choices can beat two other choices, which makes for the following interactions:

- **Rock** crushes **Scissors** and crushes **Lizard**
- **Paper** covers **Rock** and disproves **Spock**
- **Scissors** cuts **Paper** and decapitates **Lizard**
- **Lizard** eats **Paper** and poisons **Spock**
- **Spock** smashes **Scissors** and vaporizes **Rock**

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling, making the page visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For the game logic, random selection of computer choices, and score tracking.
